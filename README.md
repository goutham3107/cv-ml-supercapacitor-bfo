## 📌 Project Overview
Traditional Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) testing for supercapacitor materials is a time-intensive and highly resource-dependent process. Physical synthesis and testing of multiple dopant variations create severe bottlenecks in next-generation battery research.

This project introduces a **full-stack Machine Learning pipeline** capable of predicting complete CV current curves based purely on physical input parameters (Potential, Scan Rate, Oxidation state, and Dopant Matrix). By replacing physical trial-and-error with high-accuracy AI, this tool accelerates the research of Zinc and Cobalt-substituted Bismuth Ferrite ($BiFeO_3$).

## 🚀 Key Results & Validation
The pipeline utilizes a Stacked Meta-Model approach, combining an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest, and XGBoost using a RidgeCV Regressor. 

Tested on a completely unseen $60~mV/s$ validation dataset, the model achieved:
* **Accuracy ($R^2$ Score):** 99.66%
* **Error Rate (RMSE):** 0.000456
* **Specific Capacitance Prediction:** 0.01732 F g⁻¹ *(vs 0.01798 F g⁻¹ Experimental Lab Value — an error margin of < 4%)*
